This mod supports both the new WoTLK EPGP formula and the old TBC or Pre-WoTLK formula for calculating GP price.

By default the new WoTLK EPGP formula is used.

If you want to use the old formula modify the EPGP.lua file in this mod and edit the following:
	
Around line 47 is:
	
local use_pre_wotlk_formula = 0

Change this to:
	
local use_pre_wotlk_formula = 1

You're done. The old formula will now be used.

Enjoy!
